The header shows users:

- that they are using a Government service or product
- which domain they are on, GOV.UK, a Land Registry external service, or a staff system 
- which service or product they are using

If you use the page template, you'll also get the header without having to add it, as it's included by default.

The Land Registry header is complementary to the GOV.UK header so that users are reassured they are working with a Government department, and can use the familiar conventions they have learnt from interacting with the UK Government.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "header", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## When to use this component

### GOV.UK header

You must use the GOV.UK header at the top of every page if your service is being hosted on one of these domains:

- gov.uk/myservice
- myservice.service.gov.uk
- myblog.blog.gov.uk

### Land Registry header

You must use the Land Registry Government header at the top of every page if your service is being provided:

- as a public or professional user service, but is not hosted on a gov domain
- is for staff

The header can expand to the full width of the page.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "header", example: "full-width", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## How it works

The Land Registry header works exactly the same as the GOV.UK header, but replaces the GOV.UK specific content. The Crown, Transport font and GOV.UK border colour are replaced.

This is the first version of the Land Registry header. It's a simpler version than the GOV.UK header.

If you need to extend its use, you should extend it in the same was as the GOV.UK header is used.

{# ### Default header #}

{# Use the default header if your service has 5 pages or fewer. #}

{# ### Header with service name #}

{# Use the header with a service name if your service is more than 5 pages long - this can help users understand which service they are using. #}

{# ### Header with service name and navigation #}

{# Use the header with navigation if you need to include basic navigation, contact or account management links. #}
