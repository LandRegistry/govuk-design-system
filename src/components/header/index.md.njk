The HM Land Registry header shows users that they are on HM Land Registry and which service they are using.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "header", example: "default", id: "default-1", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## How it works

### Header with service name

Use the header with a service name if your service is more than 5 pages long - this can help users understand which service they are using.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "header", example: "with-service-name", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

### Options

A full list of options for this component can be found on the [HM Land Registry frontend Storybook](https://hmlr-frontend-prealpha.herokuapp.com/?path=/story/experimental-header--standard).
