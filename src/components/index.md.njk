Components are reusable parts of the user interface. You can use the individual components in different patterns and contexts.

You should:
- use [GOV.UK Design System components](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/) where possible
- check [our backlog](/community/backlog/) for components that are being worked on
- create new or adapt GOV.UK components only when you can demonstrate that GOV.UK ones do not work in your context
- be sharing new and adapted components with the community

Tell us what components you need so we prioritise getting them published.

## Component sets

Different components may be needed on HM Land Registry services and products depending on what domain they sit in and what kind of service it is.

### GOV.UK components

Use GOV.UK components if your service is all of the following:
- public-facing
- transactional
- sits on a gov.uk or service.gov.uk domain

You should:
- use [GOV.UK Design System styles](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/)
- speak to our designers who work on GOV.UK services for any HM Land Registry adaptations

### HM Land Registry components

Use HM Land Registry components if your service is internal, such as a caseworking or admin system.

You should speak to designers working on casework systems, as they are documenting components and advice.

## How to get involved

Talk to the design system steering group to:
- get access to the components documentation we have
- find out how you can help
- get advice on what to do if you think you have a new component, or need one
