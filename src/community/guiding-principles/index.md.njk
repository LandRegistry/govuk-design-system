Using the [MoSCoW method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) a set of guiding principles has been established for working with and contributing to the HM Land Registry Design System.

In this context, "services" refers to internal, professional and public-facing HM Land Registry services.

## Existing requirements

1. Services hosted on `service.gov.uk` **must** use the GOV.UK Design System as a requirement from the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-your-service-look-like-govuk).
2. New services not on `.gov.uk` **must** use the HM Land Registry Design System as per the HM Land Registry platform development standards.

## Using the Design System

1. Existing services not on `.gov.uk` **should** be adapted to use the Design System.
2. Services **must** use components, patterns and styles from the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) when they are available and applicable.
3. Services **must** use HM Land Registry components, patterns and styles when they are available and applicable and when they do not exist in the GOV.UK Design System.

## Contributing to the Design System

1. Collaboration on the Design System **must** be open source whenever possible.
2. All additions and modifications **must** meet the [contribution criteria](/community/contribution-criteria/).
3. Components, patterns and styles **should** align to the [Government Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles).
4. Components, patterns and styles **should not** be designed and developed in isolation or for a single service.
5. New components, patterns and styles **could** be shared with and merged into the GOV.UK Design System.
6. Anyone **should** be able to contribute to the HM Land Registry Design System.
