### The value of performance analysis in design systems

Duncan MacGruer
1:30pm to 2pm

When developing a digital service, it's rare to think about how it actually performs. This is particularly true when we are dealing in fragmented landscapes with complex end-to-end user journeys.

To demonstrate why you should add a performance resource to your Design System, I'll explain how the Scottish Government is tracking captures, user interactions and real questions we've answered.

### Light and dark: product managers in design systems

Alessandra Balliana

### Break

### Closing keynote: The power of connection through communities of practice

Emily Webber
3pm to 3:45pm

Humans are social beings; we are wired to connect. In a world where we are spending more time apart through hybrid working or just working too much, we need connection more than ever.

In this talk, Emily, author of Building Successful Communities of Practice, will share some of her experience of building communities of practice for around 20 years, how she brought them into the workplace and the power they have to support people, grow confidence and skills, bridge knowledge, create the space for collaboration across silos and generally make people happier.

### Closing remarks

3:45pm to 4pm

### Social (optional)

4pm to 5pm

Join us for an optional social afterwards where you can mix with other attendees for a chat and a drink.
