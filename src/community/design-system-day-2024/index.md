Thanks to all who joined us in Liverpool for this year's face to face event!
</p>

Our latest event took place on Thursday 5 September 2024 at St George's Hall in Liverpool. 200 members of our community joined us to hear [a wide range of talks](/community/design-system-day-2024/session-information) on this year's theme 'unsung heroes of design systems' from our brilliant [speakers](/community/design-system-day-2024/speaker-information). Each session was recorded and will be shared through [our mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/707ce8dec373/get-updated-by-email-govuk-design-system) in the coming months.

We plan to run one final online Design System Day later this year. More details on this will be released soon.
