The contents of the Design System must be of a high quality and meet user needs. To guarantee this, all components and patterns need to meet certain criteria.

Our contribution criteria currently mirrors the [contribution-criteria from GDS](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/contribution-criteria/).
