This roadmap shows what we’re working on and planning to do.

Some things on the roadmap might change – the purpose is to tell you what’s coming up and help service teams prepare and plan their own work.

See our [GitHub team board](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/53) for more details on our plans and day-to-day activities.

Last updated 29 August 2024.

## Recently shipped

We’ve released [GOV.UK Frontend v5.6.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.6.0), which introduces a new [Service navigation](/components/service-navigation/) component. We’ve also published a new pattern to [Help users to navigate a service](/patterns/navigate-a-service).

We’ve also recently:

- updated the list of organisations and brand colours
- added a new feature to stop long words from ‘breaking’ out of components
- improved how the Breadcrumbs component appears on screen readers
- fixed some alignment issues with Radio buttons and Checkboxes
- introduced new features to help you include only the components your service uses
- introduced a new [‘Password input’ component](/components/password-input/)
- updated the crown in the header, favicon and social share images
- updated the components, patterns and styles to be compliant with WCAG 2.2
- made it easier for teams to understand [what's changed in WCAG 2.2 and what they need to do](/accessibility/wcag-2.2)

## Working on now

We're:

- making the guidance around form design and validation easier to find
- working out how the Design System might need to change when used for pages embedded in apps using web views

## Coming up next

We're getting ready to:

- improve the way we organise technical documentation on the website

## Future plans

We plan to:

- [drop support for Ruby Sass and LibSass](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/2637) and [migrate to the Sass module system](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1791)
