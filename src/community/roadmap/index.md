This roadmap shows what we’re working on and planning to do.

Some things on the roadmap might change – the purpose is to tell you what’s coming up and help service teams prepare and plan their own work.

See our [GitHub team board](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/53) for more details on our plans and day-to-day activities.

Last updated 17 May 2024.

## Recently shipped

We’ve released [GOV.UK Frontend v5.4.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.4.0) which includes new features to help you include only the components your service uses.

We've also:

- introduced a new [‘Password input’ component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/password-input/)
- updated the crown in the header, favicon and social share images
- updated the components, patterns and styles to be compliant with WCAG 2.2
- made it easier for teams to understand [what's changed in WCAG 2.2 and what they need to do](/accessibility/wcag-2.2)
- made it easier for teams to [share their findings from user research](/community/share-research-findings/)

## Working on now

We're:

- investigating the [Navigation pattern](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/76)
- making the guidance around form design and validation easier to find
- working out how the Design System might need to change when used for pages embedded in apps using web views
- starting to plan Design System Day 2024

## Coming up next

We're getting ready to:

- improve the way we organise technical documentation on the website

## Future plans

We plan to:

- [drop support for Ruby Sass and LibSass](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/2637) and [migrate to the Sass module system](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1791)
