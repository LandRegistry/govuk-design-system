## Font

If your service is on the service.gov.uk subdomain you must [use the GDS Transport typeface](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/).


### When not to use the GDS Transport font

If your service is publicly available on a subdomain other than service.gov.uk, use an alternative typeface like Helvetica or Arial.

We have initially opted to use a typeface of Arial for this design system.

### Casework systems

Arial is currently used.  Speak to casework designers for more advice on the typography differences used compared to GOV design system advice.

For more help regarding typographic styles, [read the GDS typography styles](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/).
