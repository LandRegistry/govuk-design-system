## Default typeface

If your service is on the service.gov.uk subdomain you must [use the GDS Transport font](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/#font).

If your service is available on a subdomain other than service.gov.uk then you must use Arial.

### Default typeface example

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "typography", example: "example", html: true, open: false, size: "m"}) }}

All the stylistic classes available from GDS can still be used. See the [GDS typography styles](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/) for the full list.

## Geo

Geo is a bespoke HM Land Registry typeface designed by award winning font foundry Dalton Maag. It is designed to reflect the qualities of the HM Land Registry Hexagonal Aerial logo and support a distinct aesthetic across the whole Corporate Identity System of HM Land Registry.

Geo is available in five weights and a full Welsh character set.

### When to use Geo typeface

Geo is not designed to be used in web services. It is only used in the HM Land Registry logo and marketing material in print.

### How to use Geo typeface

Geo typography should always be ranged left using standard capitilisation rules.

Geo Headline is designed to be used in sizes above 14pt. Geo Headline Italic, Bold or Bold Italic do not exist. Emphasis should be created by scale, proportion and colour.

Geo Regular, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic are specifically designed for running text and smaller type sizes of 11pt/12pt.

The Geo typeface must not be manipulated, it is a core representation of HM Land Registry and consequently its appearance and character must never be altered.

### Geo typeface example

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "typography", example: "geo", html: false, open: false, size: "l"}) }}
