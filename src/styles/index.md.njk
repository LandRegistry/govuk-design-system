We style HM Land Registry (HMLR) services in different ways depending on:
  - what domain they're in
  - who the service is for
  - what kind of service it is

## HM Land Registry design styles

Use HMLR design styles if your service is internal. For example, a caseworking or admin system.
You should speak to designers working on casework systems for advice. They're developing reusable elements and advice.

## GOV.UK design styles
Use GOV.UK design styles if your service is all of the following:
- public-facing
- transactional
- sits on a gov.uk or service.gov.uk domain

You should:
- use [GOV.UK Design System styles](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/)
- speak to our designers who work on GOV.UK services for any HM Land Registry adaptations
