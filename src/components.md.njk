Components are reusable parts of the user interface. You can use the individual components in different patterns and contexts.

You should:

- use [GOV.UK Design System components](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/) where possible
- create new or adapt Gov components only when you can demonstrate Gov ones do not work in your context
- be sharing new and adapted components with the community

Tell us what components you need so we prioritise getting them published.

## Non Gov Design system components

Different patterns may be needed on HM Land Registry services and products depending on what domain they sit in and what kind of service it is.

### Land Registry design components

If your service:
- is internal, such as a caseworking system or admin service

You should:
- speak to caseworking designers, as they are documenting components and advice

### GOV.UK design components

If your service:
- is public-facing and transactional, and
- sits on a gov.uk or service.gov.uk domain

You should:
- use [GOV.UK Design System styles](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/)
- speak to our designers who work on GOV.UK services for any HM Land Registry adaptations

## Components being worked on

Components that have been identified as needed or exist in more than one service in production.
