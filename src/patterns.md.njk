Patterns are best practice design solutions for specific user-focused tasks and page types.

Patterns often use one or more [components](/components/) and explain how to adapt them to the context.

You should:

- use [GOV.UK Design System patterns](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/) first
- create new or adapt Gov patterns only when you can demonstrate Gov ones do not work in your context
- share new and adapted patterns with the [community](/community/)

## Patterns being worked on

Patterns that have been identified as needed or exist in more than one service in production.
