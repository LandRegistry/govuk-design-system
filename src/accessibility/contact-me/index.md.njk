I'm Gaynor Williams; Senior Acessibility Consultant for the Design Practice in HM Land Registry. 
I provide solutions and recommendations to the design practice teams to fix accessibility issues. 
Previously I worked as an accessibility consultant and an end user assistive technology test analyst for HM Revenue and Customs. 

Feel free to contact me via Teams or email if once reading these pages, you need further guidance or advice.

Also, if you'd like to talk to me about your own /accessibility/legal-requirements/, I'd love to hear from you.
