Always use the GOV.UK colour palette: 
[Colour](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/colour/). 
You must make sure that the contrast ratio of text and interactive elements in your service meets level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1).

Always use a sans serif font like Arial and minimum size of 12​.
These are plain fonts which screen readers can easily read. 
Text should be black on a white background.
Don't use coloured fonts unless it is a hyperlink then it will be set to blue and underlined.​
