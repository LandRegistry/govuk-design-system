An accessibility statement is a page of content on your service which:

- shows people how we can be confident our services are accessible
- allows people to contact us if they get stuck
- stops people wasting their time if they wonâ€™t be able to use the service
- empowers people to hold us accountable if we are not fulfilling our responsibilities
- helps our services to be legally compliant

You want as many people as possible to be able to use your website. 
For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader

We have created a [template](https://landregistryuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/WCAGCompliance/Shared%20Documents/HM%20Land%20Registry%20Accessibility%20Statement_v4_240221.docx?d=w6007a508a6cd41b6bb0b70f20b6733b6&csf=1&web=1&e=3qkbvE) to enable you to write your Accessibility Statement for your HMLR service. You can copy and paste it into your application.

It is currently in a Word document format but we will hopefully migrate it to both HTML and markdown in the near future.
