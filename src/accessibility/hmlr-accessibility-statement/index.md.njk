We have created an [template](https://landregistryuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/WCAGCompliance/Shared%20Documents/HM%20Land%20Registry%20Accessibility%20Statement_v4_240221.docx?d=w6007a508a6cd41b6bb0b70f20b6733b6&csf=1&web=1&e=3qkbvE) to enable you to write your Accessibility Statement for your HMLR service. You can copy and paste it into your application.

It is currently in a Word document format but we will hopefully migrate it to both HTML and markdown in the near future.
