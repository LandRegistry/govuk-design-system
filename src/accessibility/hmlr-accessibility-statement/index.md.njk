An accessibility statement is a page of content on your service which:

- shows people how we can be confident our services are accessible
- allows people to contact us if they get stuck
- stops people wasting their time if they wonâ€™t be able to use the service
- empowers people to hold us accountable if we are not fulfilling our responsibilities
- helps our services to be legally compliant

You want as many people as possible to be able to use your website.
For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader


Publishing an accessibility statement is one of the things public sector organisations must do to meet the requirements of accessibility regulations.

If you identify a failure of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1, you must include it in your accessibility statement. You then have 12 weeks to fix the failure.

Some failures need to be fixed sooner because they have a higher impact on users. How long you have to fix a failure will depend on:

- the nature of the failure
- the failure's impact on users

Once you have fixed a failure, you should remove it from your accessibility statement.

You must review your accessibility statement (both of the following):

- when you make major changes
- at least once a year

The Central Digital and Data Office has created a [sample accessibility statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement) for use on public sector websites and mobile aplications.

As mentioned in our [legal requirements](/accessibility/legal-requirements/), we cannot claim [disproportionate burden](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps) in HM Land Registry so this section must be not be included.

### Jinja version

Within the HMLR govuk-frontend-flask GitHub repository there is a [Jinja version of the sample accessibility statement](https://github.com/LandRegistry/govuk-frontend-flask/blob/main/app/templates/main/accessibility.html) for use with your Python/Flask application.
