## Software Downloads

At HM Land Registry you are free to use the tools that enable you to complete the job required. However, we recommend using the following pieces of software to enable easier cross-team working.
For prototyping and wireframing, we recommend using;

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com)
- [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com)

Speak with fellow designers on your assigned projects to learn what prototyping software they are currently using.

You may need a licence to use the software. To get a licence, please contact either your Line Manager, DesignOps or Head of Design.

If you are new to Figma or Sketch, we recommend completing the tutorials that appear when you open the software for the first time and any additional tutorial resources that are readily available.

After you have downloaded the prototyping design software and completed the tutorials provided on the respective websites, download the HM Land Registry Design System Tool Kit for your chosen software.
