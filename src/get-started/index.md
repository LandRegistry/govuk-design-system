We work to the government service design standards.

The HM Land Registry Design System extends the GOV.UK Design System and Service Manual, to include items that don’t exist there, or for situations unique to Land Registry.

[Why we work to the government standard for design](/get-started/why-gov-standard/)

## New services and improving existing services

You should:

- follow the government [Service Manual design guidance](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design), [Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk), and 
[writing style](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide) first
- check this design system and in the design practice for guidance that does not exist elsewhere in government, for example because it’s unique to us
- diverge only when you can demonstrate that existing government and practice guidance does not work in your context
- be documenting and sharing your new learning with the community

## Start designing and making

Refer to the [prototyping setup guide](/get-started/prototyping/) and [production setup guide](/get-started/production/).
