The GOV.UK guide explains how to create prototypes using the GOV.UK Design System and GOV.UK Prototype Kit.

## Before you start

To make prototypes use the link below to navigate to the GOV.UK setup guide.

[GOV.UK Prototyping Setup Guide](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/prototyping/)

## Using the HM Land Registry components

Using the latest prototype kit as a base, run `npm install @hmlr/frontend` to install the HM Land Registry frontend styles and templates.

You can now import and use the HM Land Registry components in your prototype just as you can with the GovUK ones.

Example code can be found in the [components](/components/) section.
